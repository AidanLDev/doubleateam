# The Origin of the Royal Family

During one of my many daydreams, I wondered how strange it is that just being the son or daughter of specific parents will make you heir to the throne. Then I asked, how did that actually begin? How did we decide "Ok you guys will be our rulers now." This is the rabbit hole I went down.

Before England was, well England, the country we now know was split into different kingdoms such as "Northumbria", "Mercia", "East Anglia", "Wessex" etc... Each kingdom having their own rulers.

### Egbert (827 - 839)
was known as the first king who established rule overall Anglo-Saxon England, although it is not certain he had overlordship in Northumbria. So we could call him the first king of England, but it's not the strongest of claims, let's diver deeper into the past...

It's safer to say that the origins of our modern monarchy can be dated back to the late 800s and early 900s, when all of the various Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms were united by Æthelstan (895-939 AD), also known as Athelstan, of the House of Wessex to form the Kingdom of England.

So the modern-day royal family can be traced back all the way to the 900s... But what about the rulers of the Saxon kingdoms? Which was the first? And who was the first king of the first kingdom? How did this ancient hierarchy begin?

## Anglo-Saxons (410 - 1066)

It's hard to get much information about this period as there aren\'t many written records that still exist until this day, which is why it used to be known as the "Dark Ages". It was a time of war and separation from the Roman rule.

The Angles, Saxons and other German-speaking invaders saw resistance from the Romano-British, there's talk of their British Christian leader called Ambrosius who was famed for winning 12 battles against the invaders, later accounts call this leader Arthur. Although there's no hard evidence of this \"King Arthur\" who lead the British actually existed so that doesn't answer our question of how this all began...

Various Anglo-Saxon groups began to settle in different parts of the country and set up individual kingdoms. The above-mentioned kingdoms were constantly changing and in conflict with one another. Until they eventually formed the kingdoms we see on the map of 800 AD Britain.

### Kent

was one of the first of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form in 449. In which Hengist, possibly a prince of Angeln was their ruler. That makes Hengist was the first link in our chain of Anglo-Saxon rulers, who would become the first Monarchs of Britain. The royal family as we know dates between 449 - 2023

Æthelberht (Ethelbert) was the first Christian king, converted by St Augustine around 595 AD. This had a significant impact on the landscape of the UK, as churches were built in Canterbury, helping establish the foundation of English Christianity.

So now we know the first Christian king of one of the kingdoms based on the island of Britain, and we know the first of these kingdoms too, Kent. It's satisfying seeing how the past was pieced together, establishing the royal family and country we know today.
