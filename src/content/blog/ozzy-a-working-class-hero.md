The working class hero exhibition is running in the Birmingham Art Museum daily, 10am–5pm. 25 June - 18 January 2026. May the prince of darkness rest in peace, while the world mourns one of the worlds greatest rockstars, we celebrate his life and achievements in this exhibition. Visit the [museums website](https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/exhibitions/working-class-hero) for more information on the exhibition itself. As a life long metal fan, I have a lot to thank the work Black Sabbath did for founding my favourite genre. Without Black Sabbath there would be no metal. Even today their slow heavy riffs stand the test of time and re-listening to those classic albums will always be a pleasure.

Ozzy was a larger than life character, he achieved a lot and lived life to the fullest, many of these achievements from his solo career can be found at the art museum in Birmingham until the 18th of January 2026.

Just weeks before his death, Ozzy performed his final show on July 5, 2025, at Villa Park in Birmingham with the original Black Sabbath lineup in a concert called "Back to the Beginning." Due to his Parkinson's disease, he performed seated on a black throne, watched by over 40,000 spectators and a peak livestream audience of 5.8 million. The concert generated almost $200 million in donations for three important causes: Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and Acorn Children’s Hospice The performance was emotional and the event itself had the top names in the metal world performing throughout the day:

- Tool
- Metallica
- Slayer
- Pantera
- Gojira
- Alice in Chains
- Halestorm
- Lamb of God
- Anthrax
- Mastadon

And many more!

Aside from Black Sabbath, Ozzy had an incredibly successful solo career, he released 13 studio albums, with his first eight going platinum in the United States, and won five Grammy awards.

Beyond his groundbreaking music, Ozzy's entrepreneurial spirit gave the metal community one of its most enduring institutions: Ozzfest. Launched in 1996, this travelling festival became a rite of passage for metalheads and a crucial platform for both legendary acts and emerging bands. What started as a celebration of heavy music grew into an annual pilgrimage that introduced countless fans to new artists while letting them witness the Prince of Darkness himself command massive stages across North America and beyond.

If you're in the area or can make the trip to Birmingham, I can't recommend this exhibition enough. There's something profoundly moving about seeing the personal artifacts, costumes, and memorabilia that tell the story of a boy from Aston who became a global icon. Walking through the exhibition, you're reminded that Ozzy wasn't just a rockstar, he was authentically himself, flaws and all, and that honesty resonated with millions. The exhibition runs until January 18th, 2026, so there's still time to pay your respects and celebrate the life of a true working-class hero. Whether you're a lifelong fan or discovering his legacy for the first time, it's a fitting tribute to a man who gave us so much. Rest in peace, Ozzy. The world is a little less loud without you, but your music will thunder on forever.
