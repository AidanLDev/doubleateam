# How to get an IELTS A1 Certification for UKVI Family Visa Applications

The IELTS A1 exam is almost like a short interview, there will be you and one other test taker in the room with the examiner. The examiner will ask you and your partner a series of questions which you must respond to in English, there will also, be sections in the test where you will need to communicate with your partner. Luckily the test is broken up into 4 sections, and each section is clearly defined so you can go into the exam confident, knowing exactly what to expect.

![IELTS A1 exam structure](/blog/how-to-pass-ielts/IELTSA1TestStructure.webp)
Just to make that crystal clear, the sections are as follows:

1. Phase 1A

- Answering these 3 questions:
- - Can you spell it for me? (You will be expected to spell out your full name, letter by letter)
- - What's your name?
- - Where do you come from?
- Then you will answer some basic questions on small talk topics, such as food, hobbies and interests etc

2. Phase 1B

- You and your partner will be given a topic each, write down questions based on this topic and when instructed, you will ask your partner the questions you prepared and vice versa

3. Phase 2A

- The examiner will play a short recording, you will be given some paper with a few pictures on it, and answer the question by ticking one of the pictures provided

4. Phase 2B

- The examiner will give you both a topic that you need to have a conversation about

## How we prepared for the test

There are a lot of great free resources out there that can make you as prepared as you'll ever be to pass the IELTS test. To get a better understanding of what we\ve discussed and to see what your strengths/weaknesses are, you can go through a [sample test on ielts.org](https://www.ielts.org/about-ielts/ielts-for-migration/united-kingdom/ielts-life-skills). There are two samples on this website, papers A and B, both have their own audio tracks which should be played to answer the phase 2A questions.

Seeing where your weak points are by going through a practice test is valuable, you can then focus on the areas you need to improve. If it's the speaking phases of the test, phases 1A, 2A and 2B, going through [this list of practice questions](https://www.ieltsdeal.com/ielts-life-skills-level-a1-speaking-basic-questions-with-answers/) and understanding the example answers given should help. On the other hand if it's the listening segment, phase 2a, that you struggle with, there's a bunch of [practise listening questions here on the IELTS website.](https://www.ielts.org/for-test-takers/sample-test-questions)

A valuable learning resource is this YouTube playlist, go through some of the [IELTS Life Skills A1 Speaking and Listening videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXm_rcv0GJA&list=PLOdYbfVGcVAaQcbaVFaE_S2ylP9Fib6Me&index=5) and pay attention to the answers given. Just going through a couple of these to drill the format of the test into your mind will be super helpful as you can see live examples of questions and answers to the same sort of questions you'll be asked on the day of your exam.
