# How to spend your time in Indonesia

This is going to be a quick summary of a few places we visited and a alittle bit of insight into them to help you plan your Indonesiangetaway. We will go into more depth on places we think to deserve moreattention in separate blogs but for a nice overview, here is ourIndonesian travel guide.

## Bandung

My wife could go on for days about what Bandung is like as a city in general as she has spent most of her life living there! From a western perspective, Bandung is a breath of fresh air, it's the first city I visited after Jakarta and the climate is so much fresher. The air feels clean as it's surrounded by mountains/volcanos and the temperature is cooler as a result.

### Gunung Tangkuban Perahu

This active volcano is stunning, it's about 30km north of Bandung city and it last erupted in 2019. In fact, it just recently started smoking again when we went back in February 2022

Because of the weather, it was nice and quiet when we went too, plenty of space for photos and exploration.

## Jogja

Jogja is a historical beauty of a place, countless choices to be made as there's a lot to see in this special city in Indonesia. [We go into detail here about what there is to see in Jogja](/posts/what-to-do-in-jogja) and where we'd recommend based on our experience. A few places to note are:

### Candhari Heaven restaurant

To eat some delicious food with the most stunning backdrop and multiple places for memorable photos. We couldn't recommend this place enough. They sell a selection of refreshing drinks too so even after you're done eating, you can just relax with a few drinks and soak up that unique view of Jogja.

### Malioboro

### Malang

During our journey through Java, we made our way east to Malang, this city feels so refreshing, surrounded by the most beautiful mountainous scenery. We had a tour with

and we were so chuffed we chose them. They were very reasonable in price compared to some others and it only cost a little extra to include a cameraman who showed us all the best spots gave plenty of background and of course, took some stunning photos:
