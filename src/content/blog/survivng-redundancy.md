# Surviving the Redundancy: My Journey of Reclaiming My Job

# Intro

- Talk about the history
- Paint a picture of how relaxed things were
- Mention the acquisition
- Breifly touch on the structure, Parent company, tech sub company

# The downfall

- What caused this to happen (two major projects coming to an end)
- Failure from the business (they got a lot of money from getting the contract to a big project end of last financial year, as a result the parent company expected us to exceed an already high target. As a company we're nowhere near and they're "forced" to go into cost saving mode)

# The process

- Initial call with everyone in the company, given 30 min warning
- Consultations, 1 - 1 consultations where we were read a script
- "Restructuring", split into groups, BE/FE devs, essentially we were fihgting for one of those positions
- The interview, 5 questions, everyone in our group got the same
- Couldn't answer back

# How I passed the interview

- Practise practise practise
- ChatGPT & Google
- YouTube
- Time yourself

# Don't forget the important things

- Don't neglect your health
- Easy to go into full stress mode and just focus on surviving
- Do good things
- Don't let it strain your relationships

# Concultion

- Don't get too comfortable
- Always keep interview skills and CVs up to date
- At the end of the day, a business is made up of many parts, even if we succeed, other parts may fail and we could be at risk as a result
