Journey of Reclaiming My Job\n\n## A bit of background\n\nThe company I used to work for was a tiny family-run business based in the middle of nowhere in the British countryside. It was a great operation where everyone made a real impact. As cringy as it sounds, it was like more of a family than a company, be it a sometimes dysfunctional family. I joined them in 2018 and learned heaps of things from deving frontends with React, and working with a Node backend and SQL server database to some more DevOps-type things like working with the AWS platform itself. Due to being a small company, everyone had to wear a variety of hats.\n\nThings were super relaxed, we&#39;d work hours that suited us, we used to play boardgames after our weekly sprint meetings and often went out to lunch together. Don&#39;t get me wrong, when it came to it and the boss said it was time to push harder, we&#39;d sacrifice weekends and do what we needed to do to deliver to some major clients in the high street banking scene.\n\nThings were pretty ideal (I know the grass is always greener on the other side, but I genuinely have the best memories of my early years at this company). Things changed rapidly due to the pandemic, our office culture went down the toilet as we became a fully remote team, and in 2021, the company was acquired by a large multi-national American company. I immediately started working with a different team who was based on the other side of the country, although I did learn from that experience as we always do when we change up our usual routine, the team just didn&#39;t have the same good vibes that my OG small company team did.\n\nI&#39;m just going to briefly touch on the structure of the company, as boring as it is, it is important to understand how it works at a high level to understand what went wrong and the reason why we were put in the difficult situation we were in.\n\nSo... we were working for a sub-section of this large global company, we were the tech guys! Made up of around 200 people from up and down the country. Above us was the \&quot;group\&quot;, who made up the other 7,000 or so people, and these guys were based all around the globe.\n\n## The downfall\n\nNow this sort of thing is never simple, there are a lot of factors and moving parts in any corporation, especially one of this size. At least when I was in a company of 20 or so people it was a lot easier to see root causes and point fingers, that&#39;s less so easy when the hierarchy is large and impersonal like it is in this large company.\n\nWe had two major projects, that almost all developers who worked on bespoke development were deployed onto. We have some developers who work on specific products but the majority of developers work on bespoke software for clients. These both came to an end around Christmas 2023, and there was nothing new in the pipeline to replace them. Understandably during the rough economy we&#39;re in now, people aren&#39;t as willing to spend millions of pounds on a bespoke bit of software.\n\nOur company has a very \&quot;fair\&quot; way of setting what our yearly profit goals should be, being the amount of profit we made last year needs to be increased by 20%. One of the projects especially gave us a massive cash injection upfront of around £2,000,000. That and the fact they acquired a new tech firm based in the US, our annual profits were crazy high, meaning the amount they expected us to get this year was even crazier.\n\nAs it became clear we weren&#39;t going to hit those targets this year, the company had to go into cost-saving mode. This resulted in two office closures, making people work fully remote or causing them to commute to London rather than somewhere more local to them. And yes, they announced a \&quot;restructuring\&quot; to \&quot;streamline\&quot; their business, which meant there were fewer jobs available.\n\n## The process\n\nIt was a standard Wednesday, I was on a weekly client call when I got a meeting invite titled \&quot;All hands\&quot;.\n![All hands meeting invite on Outlook Calander](/blog/surviving-redundancy/AllHandsMeetingInvite.webp)\n\nIt was odd, to get invited to a **WHOLE company** meeting with such short notice, the invite went out about 20 mins before the meeting started. We were greeted by a sombre-looking director, which wasn&#39;t too far out of character for him but even still you could tell something was seriously wrong. The meeting was short, he told us about this restructuring that was going to be enforced and that as a result some of our roles MAY be at risk... and we were told not to ask any questions as we would have the opportunity in the upcoming one on one consultations later that week.\n\nLater that week, in the consultation meeting, that&#39;s when the news was dropped that my role was one of those at risk, at the time I was a DevOps engineer and in their new structure they just had pools of FE and BE devs and the platform was managed by an external team from outside our company.\n\nThere were a few of these consultation meetings and they felt more like corporate box-ticking than anything that was supposed to be of use to the individuals involved in this daunting process. The person running the consultation had to read a script, line for line, which I can understand was necessary from a legal point of view.\n\nThe way it worked was within the new structure of our organisation, there&#39;s going to be two pools of 10 FE developers and 9 BE developers. I was nominated by my manager to go for the FE position as he thought that&#39;s where I&#39;d have the best chance of keeping my job. It was basically like being in an interview process for a job I never applied for. We were given job descriptions and everything.\n\nThe interview itself was more like a speech than an actual interview.:\n![Invitation email where I was invited to an interview for the FE dev role](/blog/surviving-redundancy/InterviewInvite.webp)\n\nAs it states in the invite, we were given the questions they&#39;d ask us in advance, there were 5 technical questions that we were essentially graded on by our two interviewers who gave us marks out of 5 for each question. The final question was specific about the company&#39;s values and our answer to that final question would only be taken into account if there was a tie in scores.\n\nThe interviewers would ask one of the pre-prepared questions and then just take notes in complete silence, in a way to make it fair for everyone they weren&#39;t allowed to ask any follow-up questions. It felt strange talking to these two guys and not getting any sort of feedback on our answers. No chance to further clarify or explain ourselves, just answering and when we finished answering a question, they&#39;d move straight onto the next one. Overall my interview lasted for 40 minutes, which I was proud of as we were allowed a maximum of 45 minutes, so I felt like I said everything I needed to say for each of the questions.\n\n## How I passed the interview\n\n### practice practice practice!!\n\nI mean, everyone knows this already, but it&#39;s crucial... practice makes **PERFECT**. However first, you need some answers to the questions to practise. Practise yourself reading out the interview questions as if you&#39;re being interviewed, by basically doing the real thing we make ourselves prepared for the real thing. It sounds so simple, but it&#39;s so true.\n\n### Get something down, even if it&#39;s not perfect\n\nThe first thing I did when answering the questions was open up a blank Word doc and jot down the questions as headings. Under the headings, I&#39;d write my immediate rough thoughts down and think of any examples I could use to back up my thoughts from my experience.\n\n### Research and refine\n\nUsing tools like ChatGPT and Google I could get some in-depth information that helped me sound like an expert for each of the 5 questions, I&#39;d write down as much as possible and refine my rough answers\n\n### Write out a full comprehensive answer\n\nOnce I had all the information necessary to answer the questions, I wrote out my answers in full, with good articulation, grammar and everything. After reading it and refining it a few more times, I kind of got the gist of what I needed to say for each answer.\n\n### Turn the answer into bite-size bullet points\n\nI turned in my long answers into some snappy bullet points, like 5 or so under each category. Then when practising I would just try to answer the questions with only the bullet points in front of me.\n\nOn the actual interview day, we&#39;re going to be super nervous, it&#39;s extremely important to make sure we have simple but clear notes that can get us through the interview despite our condition.\n\n### Time yourself\n\nTime yourself. By this stage I had a solid set of answers, I could use my bullets to talk through it fluently and sound like I know what I&#39;m talking about somehow. Now that&#39;s all well and good, however after timing myself going through it from start to finish, it only took me 25 mins... now that isn&#39;t going to cut it, so I went back to the research and refine stage. I developed into YouTube too and learned more and more about modern-day Frontend Web development, I expanded on my answers and could sound even more like an expert.\n\nOnce adding these bits to the fully written answers, I worked them down and added them to my bullets. Once practising these answers out loud again a few times I could further improve my notes once again.\n\n### Put it all together\n\nGo through the answers out loud as many times as you can. If it&#39;s an online interview (like mine was), turn on your webcam sit where you&#39;ll be sitting and see how you look. Learn to look at the camera, not the squares on your screen and sound confident when delivering your answers. Even if you&#39;re not a confident person, you can learn how to sound confident with enough practice.\n\n## Don&#39;t forget the important things\n\nWhen the news first dropped, it was all that was on my mind, I was an active person before, often out on runs and spending weekends away visiting places. However the prospect of redundancy consumed me and I couldn&#39;t enjoy my time as much as usual, instead of staying active I&#39;d just be practising interview techniques, job searching or working on my Portfolio to make myself as employable as possible. Now preparation is key, but there&#39;s a balance we should always strive for, as when we&#39;re in that stressed state we&#39;re not doing both ourselves or anyone around us any good. It strains your relationships and damages your health.\n\n### Create healthy habits and stick to them\n\nDuring this process I could see my health and energy deteriorating, so I forced myself out of it, I joined the gym for the first time in years and have stuck to it consistently since. I love it:\n\n![Taking a mirror selfie at the gym](/blog/surviving-redundancy/gym_selfie.webp)\n\nDon&#39;t just go into survival mode, but use it as an opportunity to push you out of your comfort zone and thrive. Force yourself to pick up a healthy habit, even if it doesn&#39;t seem like it, that&#39;ll help you succeed. Remember the important things ❤️\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI was very much in my comfort zone, but this has forced me to re-evaluate, learn new skills, and get into new routines. In a way, it&#39;s re-sparked my passion for development and I&#39;ll be sure to always keep my interview skills up-to-date as we will always need them. Don&#39;t get too comfortable, at the end of the day we&#39;re not in control of everything and that&#39;s okay because we can choose to focus on the things we **can** control\n\nAlways keep your CV up to date and practise answering interview questions out loud. A business is made up of many parts, even if we succeed, other parts may fail and we could be at risk as a result.\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Surviving Redundancy&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Surviving the Redundancy process: My Journey of Reclaiming My Job&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;January 24 2024&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/interview_stock_photo.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Personal&quot;],[0,&quot;Jobs&quot;],[0,&quot;Work&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;1000most-common-indonesian-words.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;1000most-common-indonesian-words&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# The 1,000 most common Indonesian Words\n\nThere is a universal rule, that goes along the lines of this; 20% of words are used 80% of the time. This rule effects almost everything, for example 80% of wealth is owned by 20% of people and so on, but that&#39;s not the point, what I&#39;m trying to get at, is rather than cram all vocabulary you can think of into your mind, if you just learn the top 20% of words used in a language, it can go a long way.\n\\\n\\\nA tool that can be used to memorise these words is [Anki](https://www.ankiapp.com/). You can download this on PC/Mac, on iOS/Android so you can take your virtual deck of 1,000 words with you anywhere. Using a spaced repetition algorithm it will show cards in a way that will help keep store them in your long term memory so you can recall them with ease.\n\n| Number | Indonesian     | English

Building a free CI/CD pipeline using AWS S3 and CircleCI\r\n\r\nCI/CD can speed up the process of updating websites. If you&#39;re going to be working on a website over the course of days, months and even years, you will spend a lot of time deploying changes you&#39;ve made. This is where a CI/CD pipeline comes in. Push up changes to your GitHub and boom, those changes will be automatically deployed. No logging into and manually uploading your files to wherever they&#39;re being hosted from.\r\n\r\nThis guide we will utilize a services.\r\n\r\n- AWS S3\r\n- GitHub\r\n- CircleCI\r\n\r\n## Setting up S3 bucket for static hosting\r\n\r\nHead on over to the [AWS Console.](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) Search for the S3 service and hit create a new bucket. The bucket name should be the same as whatever domain, so if you owned the Google domain you would name it \&quot;google.com\&quot;, and take a note of the region.\r\n\r\n![Creating an S3 bucket](/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/create-s3-bucket.webp)\r\n\r\nLogically the region should be close to wherever the majority of users of your website are from to give a slightly better performance. You will also want to allow public access otherwise no one will be able to access your website:\r\n\r\n![Allowing public access](/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/creating-bucket2.png)\r\n\r\n## Setting up IAM User\r\n\r\nWhile we have the AWS console open, let&#39;s head on over to IAM (Identify and Access Management). We will want to give our CircleCI access to our S3 bucket so it can deploy our code to it later on down the line.\r\n\r\nOnce in the IAM service, click on Users and then press the \&quot;Add Users\&quot; button. Give your user a name then make sure you select \&quot;Access key\&quot; for it\\&#39;s access type, this gives this user access to perform actions using the AWS CLI but not console access.\r\n\r\nNow we want to add the S3 permissions to this user, you can write the policy yourself but to make things quicker and easier head on over to \&quot;Attach existing policies directly\&quot; and search for S3, I selected \&quot;AmazonS3FullAccess\&quot; to ensure they had the necessary permissions to do the job.\r\n\r\n![IAM user name](/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/iam-user-name.png)\r\n\r\nGo through the rest of the create user Wizard and when you have added the user make sure to save the \&quot;Access Key ID\&quot; and \&quot;Secret access key\&quot; somewhere safe. I like to use [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) to store my passwords as it works across all devices.\r\n\r\n## Commit code to GitHub\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason your code isn&#39;t on [GitHub](https://github.com/), create a repo and get it up on there.\r\n\r\n## Set-up CircleCI account\r\n\r\nOpen up [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and create an account, I reccomend signing up using your GitHub accoutn as you\\&#39;re going to link it to your CircleCI account anyways. Once you\\&#39;re in and have your GitHub account connected, you should be able to see your Repos. Click the \&quot;Set Up Project\&quot; button next to the repo you want to make a CI/CD pipeline for.\r\n\r\n![CircleCI set up 1](/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/circleci-setup-yml-file.png)\r\n\r\nChoose Fast and then on the next screen select \&quot;Hello World\&quot;, and just get through the rest of the initial start up by selecting \&quot;Use Existing Config\&quot; then \&quot;Start Building\&quot; as we now want to get into our Repo code and will start creating a config file to handle the CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Adding .circleci config to your project\r\n\r\nAt the top level directory, create a new folder called .circleci and in that folder a file called config.yml. In here you will want to add the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: 2.1\r\norbs:\r\n  aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@1.0.6\r\ndescription: |\r\n  copy files to S3 bucket and then create an Cloudfront invalidation\r\n  on the distribution.\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    docker:\r\n      - image: &#39;circleci/python:latest&#39;\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n      - checkout\r\n      - aws-s3/sync:\r\n          from: out\r\n          to: &#39;s3://example.com&#39;\r\n          arguments: |\r\n            --acl public-read \\\r\n\r\n            --cache-control \&quot;max-age=86400\&quot; \\\r\n\r\n            --exclude \&quot;.git/*\&quot; \\\r\n\r\n            --exclude \&quot;.gitignore\&quot; \\\r\n\r\n            --exclude \&quot;.circleci/*\&quot; \\\r\n\r\n          overwrite: true\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwap out the following:\r\n\r\n- To s3://example.com&#39;to be s3://yourbucketname\r\n- from: . should be updated to the folder that holds the files you want to serve are such as dist, build, out etc.\r\n\r\nSomething to note, if you want to move across all the files in your repo to S3, swap out from: out with from: .\r\n\r\nPush up those changes and watch the pipeline build on CircleCI! If all is well, then you should see the build go green\r\n\r\n## Debugging your pipeline\r\n\r\nBefore successfully getting my pipeline up and running, I ran into a couple of errors, just in-case you hit the same ones I&#39;ll go through the error and my solution.\r\n\r\n`usage: aws s3 sync {&#39;&lt;LocalPath&gt;&#39;} {&#39;&lt;S3Uri&gt;&#39;} or {&#39;&lt;S3Uri&gt;&#39;}{&#39; &#39;}\r\n          {&#39;&lt;LocalPath&gt;&#39;} or {&#39;&lt;S3Uri&gt;&#39;} {&#39;&lt;S3Uri&gt;&#39;}\r\n          Error: Invalid argument type`\r\n\r\nI had to update the to: &#39;s3://your-bucket&#39; to match my bucket name, before I was putting in the actual S3 bucket URL.\r\n\r\n`The user-provided path ./out/* does not exist.

Let&#39;s go through the steps for hosting a static site using Netlify.\n\n## Pre requisites\n\nThere really isn&#39;t much involved to get your site hosted up on Netlify for the world to see, just a couple of steps:\n\n- Your code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n- You have a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account\n\n## Getting started\n\nHead on over to Netlify and on choose to connect your GitHub. If you haven&#39;t authorised Netlify to use GitHub, you will quickly have to go through some dialogue to give Netlify relevant access.\n\nOn the next screen select the repo that stores the code of the website you want to host.\n\nFinally, go through and customise the settings to your liking. One thing you will want to change is the domain name, as by default it will be a random pile of letters and numbers. Under Custom Domains click the options and click Edit site name. Now you can&#39;t completely modify the site name here as it will always have a suffix of .netlify.app. However, you can make it something memorable and relevant to your site which is nice as it saves you from having to go out and buy your own domain name, which can be pretty pricy especially if you want a good name with a .com Top Level Domain (TLD). However, if you do already have a domain, you can hook this up to your newly hosted website too.\n\n## Updating your website\n\nWhen building a website, we constantly make changes. Now to deploy those changes, with Netlify it&#39;s as simple as committing and pushing those commits to `GitHub`\n\n![Netlify Deploying message](/blog/deploying-netlify/netlify-deploy-message.png)\n\nFor anyone, like me, who&#39;s spent far too long setting up, debugging and even waiting for a CI/CD pipeline, you will be amazed at the speed at which Netlify deploys updates. Within the same minute of pushing to `master`/`main`...\n\n![Netlify Deployed message](/blog/deploying-netlify/netlify-deployed-message.png)\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Hosting a website for free&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Hosting a website for free&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;August 27 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/netlify-free-static-hosting.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;DevOps&quot;],[0,&quot;Hosting&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;alton-towers.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;alton-towers&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# All you need to know about Alton Towers\n\nThe biggest park in the UK, coming in at a massive 910 acres of thrills, stunning well-kept gardens, and stately home.

Although a word of warning, I did turn up 15 mins late for my breakfast at the restaurant I was supposed to eat at, [the Brewers Fayre](https://www.brewersfayre.co.uk/en-gb) and they already gave away my table. However, haven eaten at a few Brewers Fayres fine establishments in the past, you&#39;re in for a treat if you do, good pub food and a stacked breakfast buffet that will cover all tastes. From fry ups to fruit, pastries and cereals too.\n\n![brewers fayres full English breakfast... delicious](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/brewers-fayre-breakfast.webp)\n\nWell with the original breakfast plans going out the window, in the town centre, I found a nice weather spoons too which will sort you out with a big old breakfast for less than £10.\n![spoons breakfast](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/spoons-breakfast.webp)\n\nRight, enough about food!\n\n## Price\n\nAlways book online in advance if you&#39;re planning a day out to Towers, it will save you a big chunk of money.

There&#39;s nothing like it (well apart from the other nemesis in Thorpe Park), but what makes this one feel more special is the way it integrates with its terrain. You dash past rocks that were blasted out especially to make room for this special coaster and you pass over this giant alien creator a few times. This coaster is properly intense, so if that&#39;s your thing be sure to give it a ride\n\n### Oblivion\n\n![Oblivion](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/oblivion.webp)\nWorlds first dive coaster | length: 1,222 ft | height: 65 ft | drop 180ft | speed: 68 mph\n\nDon&#39;t look down!

A selection of family friendly and thrilling flat rides can be found scattered about the park. Here&#39;s a selection of said rides:\n\n### Gangsta Granny The Ride\n\n![Gangsta Granny The Ride](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/gangsta-granny.webp)\nDavid Walliams&#39; Gansta Granny perfect for families\n\n### Retro Squad\n\n![Retro Squad](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/retro.webp)\nRetro themed flat rides featuring Spinjam, a Tivoli Extreme | Funk n Fly, a Super Trooper | Roller Disco, a waltzer\n\nOnly for those with strong stomachs, fun carnival vibes with these classic flat rides and the music for all of these attractions will have you dancing and signing like an old-school disco.\n\n### Enterprise\n\n![Enterprise](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/enterprise.webp)\nThis ride generates enough Gs to let you invert without restraints, a fun experience, you will feel like an astronaut training for a mission to Mars.\n\n### Curse of Alton Towers\n\n![Curse of Alton Towers](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/duel.webp)\nThis ride came out March 2023, I&#39;ve not had a chance to ride it yet so I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give it a personal review, although from what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s a quality flat ride!\n\n### Hex\n\n![Hex](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/hex.webp)\nAgain I&#39;m so sorry to say that I&#39;ve not actually given Hex a go, the last couple of times I was at the park this mysterious dark ride was either down for maintenance or I just didn&#39;t get round to riding it!\n\n## The Towers and Gardens\n\nWe can&#39;t talk about Alton Towers without mentioning the old stately home that takes up a sizeable chunk of the park.\n\nThe history of Alton Towers: The stately home was once the largest private house in Europe. The house has historically been owned by the Talbot family since 1406 when Sir John Talbot acquired the estate when he married Maud. He was the first Earl of Shrewsbury. The 19th Earl decided to open the grounds up to the public to fund repairs to the house around the 1890s. This inspired the 20th early to develop the state for tourist attractions. However, when the earl and his wife separated in 1896, he left his wife to live on the estate, although he refused to spend money on the up-keep of the building. A group of local businessmen bought the estate and formed \&quot;Alton Towers Limited\&quot;. By the 1920s they opened the grounds up to the public and added cafes, it was extremely popular during the 20s and 30s. When world war 2 broke out, the estate was re-purposed as a cadet training camp.\n\n![stately home](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/stately-home.webp)\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Towers began to see fair rides and other attractions spring up on the grounds, while the building itself was left deserted after taking heavy damage during the war. Although concrete floors were added to the house so visitors could enter and walk around. By the 1980s, the new owners of Alton Towers, inspired by Disney, wanted to open up a fully-fledged theme park. They themed streets inspired by Disney parks and opened up a new coaster that was the start of Alton Towers as we know it today... The Corkscrew. This was an instant hit, with line wait times going up 6 hours.\n\n![Corckscrew](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/corckscrew.webp)\n\nTo get an aerial view of the stunning grounds, you can take the Skyride to one area of the park to another. You will be entertained by audio describing some of the histories of the park as well as a distinctive view of the park.\n\nThere are many hidden gems of beauty throughout the park, you can walk through the gardens where you&#39;ll see water features [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DJvMwqZresk)\n\nThroughout the park, there&#39;s beauty, this waterfall is outside one of the best rides, The Wicker Man:\n![Waterfall-still](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/waterfall-still.webp)\n\n![Me and big B](/blog/theme-parks/alton-towers/me-and-bob.webp)\n\nThere&#39;s nowhere else quite like Alton Towers. It offers a little something to everyone, while being a stunning location in the process.\n\n[Oblivions Drop](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7DU5imb760M)\n\n[Towers Waterfall](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MS2aBsQJG-g)\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Things to know about Alton Towers&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Things to know about Alton Towers&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;August 21 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/alton-towers.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Entertainment&quot;],[0,&quot;Theme Parks&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;best-uk-theme-parks.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;best-uk-theme-parks&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# UKs Best Theme parks\n\nThis island holds a lot of thrill, with some of the world&#39;s best coasters scattered between various parks.

Located in Staines, not too far from London, this park packs a punch. It&#39;s compact full of record breaking thrill rides such as the UK&#39;s fastest roller coaster Stealth.\n\nThorpe park as some incredibly well themes rides, such as the terrifying Walking Dead ride where you&#39;ll be chased by live actors, to Swarm, a fantastic wing coaster, where you fly past a crashed plane and through a billboard.

The log flume, Tiger Rock, has you float past a Tiger enclosure on your journey through the water before you hit the big drop that is.\n\nThere&#39;s plenty for the children here, with Gruffalo and Room on a Broom just being a couple of them. The areas are well themed, especially the Mexicana area which had a welcome lick of paint recently, where you can ride the Scorpion Express, formally known as the Runaway Train.\n\nThe Vampire is a must ride, a well themed suspended coaster that has you flying above the park and Dragons Fury, the Maurer spinning coaster, never fails to put the biggest smile on my face. A unique ride every time as the spinning is completely random.\n\nThe coaster line-up is a bit light, but as of writting this artical, a B&amp;M wing coaster in the Jemanji land will be opening in 2023!\n\n## 4. Legoland Windsor\n\n![Legoland Windsor](/blog/theme-parks/legoland-windsor.webp)\nWindsor | £32 Online or free with a Merlin Pass\n\nLegoland just brings back the best memories, it&#39;s where I passed my first driving test at the age of 4 or so. Plenty to do here as a family.\n\nIt offers a few nicely themed coasters, Dragon and Dragon&#39;s Apprentice being two of them. They&#39;re both located in the knights kingdom and as the name suggests, themed to dragons\n\nMiniland is a must visit while you&#39;re here, you can see some of the most famous attractions built in Lego with fantastic attention to detail.\n\n## 5. Blackpool Pleasure Beach\n\n![](/blog/theme-parks/blackpool/icon.webp)\nBlackpool | £30 - £40 Online\n\nI always feel like I&#39;m going back in time when I step foot here, in the nicest way possible that is. They do have wooden coasters that have been around since the 1920s after all. The park has such a fun atmosphere and you get a great view of the sea too as it&#39;s right on the coast.\n\nThere&#39;s many unique attractions here, such as Revolution, a launch into a loop... then you get launched backwards back through the loop! It&#39;s surprisingly intense and a LOT of fun. Avalanche, a bobsled coaster and just so much more.\n\nThe Icon is regarded as the best in the UK by many thrill seekers, this double launch coaster is such a blast every time I ride it. Talking of coasters, you can&#39;t forget the BIG ONE, still the tallest in the UK, a title it&#39;s held since 1994 (the best year). Although Thorpe Park might have there eyes on that record (if planning permissions ever get accepted).\n\n## 6. Paultons\n\n![Paultons](/blog/theme-parks/paultons.webp)\nRomsey, Hampshire | £40 Online (under 1m get in for free)\n\nPaultons, home of Pepper Pig land, a family friendly theme park that has plenty to keep a thrill seeker entertained. The park has a relaxing atmosphere with beautiful gardens and animals.\n\nWe can&#39;t talk about Paultons without mentioning one of the best UK coasters, Storm Chaser, a fun spinning coaster that will have you smiling from ear to ear.

Flamingo Land\n\n![Flamingo Land](/blog/theme-parks/flamingoland.webp)\nKirby Misperton, North Yorkshire | £29 - 40 Online\n\nI know, the name suggests that this is just a place full of Flamingos... although it does have a Zoo, this \&quot;Theme park resort\&quot; also offers some thrills from rides such as Flip Flop and Cliff Hanger. In fact the Zoo is well maintained and attracts more visitors than the ZSL London Zoo which is impressive.\n\nThe park offers plenty of attractions for children too with the likes of Mumbo Jumbo and Vortex.\n\nThe park&#39;s latest coaster \&quot;Sik\&quot;, which packs in a whopping 10 inversions, just opened this year and is well worth a ride.\n\n## 9. Drayton Manor\n\n![Drayton Manor](/blog/theme-parks/drayton-manor.webp)\nMileoak, Brighton | £27.50\n\nDrayton Manor is a great family park with a solid line up of attractions. Loki is just mesmorising to look at off ride. The park hosts the UKs only standing roller coaster, Shockwave, which is just an experience that feels incredibly odd, a must try experience.\n\nFor younger children there&#39;s an entire Thomas the Tank Engine section. Other family favorites are Flying Dutchman and Accelerator. Thrill seekers will enjoy Shockwave and on a sunny day Stormforce 10 is sure to cool you down.\n\nOverall this park has improved in recent years, the theming of it&#39;s new Viking land has a lot of attention to detail. I mean just look at Loki... How can you take your eyes off it?!\n\n## 10. Oakwood Theme Park\n\n![Oakwood Theme Park](/blog/theme-parks/oakwood.webp)\nPembrokeshire, South Wales | £27 - £37\n\nThe biggest theme park in Wales, the hosts of Megafobia which is a highly rated wooden coaster. There&#39;s a good variety of rides across the park, the other thrill coaster Speed is a lot of fun too. There are a couple of family friendly coasters too so the whole family can enjoy a day out in Oakwood.\n\nThe park is green and spacious in the beautiful Welsh countryside. Not a bad small park, worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area. Especially if you want to ride a great woddie.\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Best UK Theme Parks&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Best UK Theme Parks&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;August 15 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/best-uk-theme-parks.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Entertainment&quot;],[0,&quot;Theme Parks&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;marriage-requirements.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;marriage-requirements&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# International Marriage in Indonesia guide\n\nWeddings in Indonesia are always religious ceremonies, this can make things a bit complicated if you’re from a different religious background from your spouse. However, with the right documents, this isn’t an issue. We’ll talk through everything we needed to get married and the steps we took to get there.\n\nIf you’re a British citizen this will ask you to go through a short series of questions to point you to the embassy, you need to contact to get the required wedding docs [Getting married abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-abroad)\n\n## Foreign spouse documents\n\nThere are a few documents the foreign spouse will need for getting married in Indonesia.\n\n- Affidavit/affirmation to prove that all previous relationships have ended\n- Email the relevant embassy in Jakarta and book an appointment to swear an Affidavit – The British Embassy was very responsive and managed to get us an appointment the very week we emailed. They charge a fee of £50\n- If the Indonesian spouse is Muslim, you will need a shahada certificate. I got mine from the central London Mosque, you can contact them here. Although some KUAs (the Indonesian registry office) will allow the foreign spouse to take their shahada as part of the wedding ceremony or privately with them just before the wedding.\n- ID - Your passport, which you should have with you anyways! So, this requirement is a freebee yay. Just in case you might want to bring along something like a driving licence if you have one\n\nHere’s where you can [contact the London Mosque](https://www.iccuk.org/page2.php?section=contact&amp;page=contact) if you are from the UK and need to get your hands on a shahada certificate\n\nThese docs may not be necessary however some areas may have stricter KUAs who will require the following:\n\n- Birth Certificate\n- Certificate of domicile\n\n## Local Indonesian spouse documents\n\n- Marriage introduction letter from RT &amp; RW\n- KTP\n- KK\n\nAgain these docs may not be necessary however some KUAs will ask for the following:\n\n- Parents KTP and KK\n- Death certificate (if parents have passed away)\n- ID cards of 2 witnesses\n\n## Photos\n\nYou will both need to get professional photos taken where with the following format: 2 x 3 with a blue background – 3 sheets\n\nEnglish documents will need to be translated by an approved sworn translator; we used the Juliani Language Centre [A list of translators provided by the British gov site.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/indonesia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-translatorsinterpreters-in-indonesia)\n\nYou want to choose a translator who can translate documents, it’s best to ask a few for their price list as they can vary a lot from one translator to another.\n\nThe only two documents I needed translating were my birth certificate and passport. Luckily for us, the British embassy printed out the Affidavit in both English and Indonesian so that didn’t need translating, if you don’t have the Affidavit/ affirmation in Indonesian you’ll have to get that translated too.\n\n## Prenup and Indonesian marriage rights for marriages with foreign spouses\n\nThis part is a bit complicated… sadly if you do get married to a foreign spouse, the local spouse will lose their property and inheritance rights in Indonesia. This is because when married, they share the rights of their spouse, their spouse being foreign doesn’t have property rights therefore they inherit the same rights as a result… Or something along those lines!\n\nTo avoid this, we contacted a notary to arrange a prenup (pre-marital agreement) that would allow my lovely wife the rights she deserves. A list of English-speaking notaries who are in Indonesia [can be found here.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/indonesia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-notaries-public-in-indonesia) Although we just found a notary local to where my wife lives in Bandung and they were super helpful. Overall, the prenup cost us 2.5 million Indonesia Rupia (est £140)\n\n## Documents from various Indonesian administration areas (RT &amp; RW &amp; Kelurahan &amp; Kecematan)\n\nFirst, a bit of explaining what those words above mean: Indonesia is divided into different regions, in these regions they’re third-level administrative subdivisions below regencies or cities known as Kacematans. Kelurahan is a subdivision below kacematans, so they’re a fourth-level subdivision which translates to “villages” in English. Finally, below this, we have the RT (rukun tetangga which can translate to “neighbourhood unit”) and RW (Rukan Warga which can translate to “community unit”). These are the division below the Kelurahan. An RW is made up of many RT, so that is the most local area to an Indonesian resident. I hope this at least slightly makes sense, to me it’s still confusing, Indonesia is just such a huge country, so it can take a lot to get our heads around how it’s divided up and organised if you haven’t lived there.\n\nYou’ll need to grab a handful of documents from your local RT/RW and attach some of the documents mentioned above in the documents required section. Once you have the translated documents, visit the local Kelurahan and provide them with the relevant documents. After finishing with the kelurahan documents, go to the kacamatan to request the documents for the KUA.\n\n## Immunisation\n\nAfter we visited the KUA with copies of the documents from the various regency offices, the Indonesian spouse had to get a tetanus immunisation before we could marry.\n\n## Congratulations\n\nBring all the documents to the KUA and that’s that! You’re ready to get married\n\nThe start of your new life as husband and wife, suami and istri, can now begin. Enjoy the precious time with family and friends, savour the moment, but most importantly look after each other and enjoy the rest of your lives together\n\nWe wish you all the best in your future\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;International Marriage in Indonesia&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;International Marriage in Indonesia&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;July 20 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/marriage-requirements.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Marriage&quot;],[0,&quot;Indonesia&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;what-to-do-in-jogja.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;what-to-do-in-jogja&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# Our Jogja recommendations\n\n## Hotel 1 - Jambuluwuk Malioboro\n\nWe stayed very central in the Jambuluwuk Malioboro Hotel. This is a large hotel with some outstanding views, friendly staff and a huge buffet breakfast with foods from all over Indonesia and even some European options. I mean just check out this stunning garden you&#39;ll be stuffing your faces in!\n\n![Jambuluwuk Malioboro Hotel Garden](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/hotelBreakfastGarden.webp)\n\nThe hotel has a laundry service and is within walking distance to the popular shopping district in Malioboro. Plenty to see and do just on your doorstep! The hotel was reasonable considering the location and especially considering the 5\\* service we were getting, the staff were stars and the hotel itself was so well furnished. It cost around £27 (est 487.000 IDR) a night\n\n## restaurant\n\nWe fancied heading out of the main part of the city to soak in some of the views you can get around Jogja. At the Candhari Heaven you can do just that while eating some delicious Indonesian food or even just sitting back and enjoying some of their refreshing fruit smoothies.\n\n![Candhari Heaven restaurants food](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/niceResturantFood.webp)\n\nNow this place does get busy, so to guarantee a table we would recommend booking in advance. [Their Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/candhariheaven/) and their number `+6281282677677`.\n\n![Candhari Heaven restauran](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/niceResturant.webp)\n\n![Candhari Heaven restaurant view](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/niceResturantView2.webp)\n\n## Malioboro\n\nThe street where it all happens!\n\n![Malioboro street](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/malioboro.webp)\n\nWhat a fun place to be! If you fancy doing some shopping or eating ice cream, Malioboro is the place to do it. With countless street performers and more shops than you&#39;ll know what to do with, this vibrant place is a must-visit when coming to Jogja.\n\nJogja was HOT when we visited, so this icecream went down an absolute treat.\n![Gelato in malioboro](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/malioboroGelato.webp)\n\n## Hotel 2 - Balkondes Ngargogondo The Gade Village\n\nNow all of those activities we&#39;ve talked about so far happen in the heart of Jogja, however, if you venture outside the city by an hour or so, there&#39;s so much history and beauty to be witnessed. Now if there&#39;s one the thing we love more than travel, it&#39;s sleep, so in order to make it to the famous sunrise spot \&quot;Punthuk Setumbu\&quot; we&#39;d have to be a little closer to it than our hotel near Malioboro. Balkondes Ngargogondo The Gade Village was fairly pricy for what you get at 500.000 IDR a night, but what a location. It was only 15 mins away from Punthuk Setumbu and felt like such a breathe of fresh air, you&#39;re truly out in nature here.\n\n![Gade Village rooms](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/hotel2Rooms.webp)\n\nJust looking at those rooms relaxes me, beautiful. The welcome we got there was top notch too, we were given complimentary drinks and breakfast was brought to our door as there was an event on that morning so we couldn&#39;t use the restaurant.\n\n![Gade Village Breakfst](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/hotel2Breakfast.webp)\n\nThe breakfast was tasty and traditional, although we do love our breakfast buffets where we can stuff our faces until our bellies can&#39;t fit any more food in.\n\n## Punthuk Setumbu\n\nThe reason why we trecked outside of the city, and my god was it worth it.\n\n![Punthuk Setumbu](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/sunriseSignCrop.webp)\n\nThis popular sunrise location is popular for a reason. Sadly it was a a bit cloudy for us to get the full sunrise experience, but we did however get blown away by the beauty of the place.\n\n![Punthuk Setumbu](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/sunrisePlace.webp)\n\nThere are plenty of places for some the most memorable photos too if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into.\n\n![Punthuk Setumbu](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/loveSign.webp)\n\nWe&#39;ll let the pictures do all the talking for this one...\n\n![Punthuk Setumbu](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/sunrisePlace2.webp)\n\n![Punthuk Setumbu](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/sunrisePlace3.webp)\n\nEven though you&#39;re out in the middle of nowhere, there are food sellers, and toilets too. What more could you ask for.\n\n## Borobudur\n\nYou can&#39;t come out all the way to Jogja and not visit one of its ancient temples. We were torn between two, with it being our final day in Jogja we could only choose one, Borobudur or the Prambanan Temple... well as we&#39;re talking about Borobudur you can guess which we chose. Borobudur Temple is magnificent, the biggest Buddhist temple built. For Indonesian citizen&#39;s tickets are very cheap, however, if you&#39;re foreign you will be expected to pay a bit extra, around £20 overall, however where else can you see such a magnificent landmark? Worth every penny.\n\n![Borobudur](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/boroboudor.webp)\n\n## Traveling to Jogja\n\n![Cepat Bus to Jogja](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/bus-bandung-jogja.webp)\n\nIn case you&#39;re traveling to Jogja within Indonesia like we were, we thought we&#39;d go through some options. We made the journey from Bandung, the comfortable quicker way was using the train. Even the cheapest seats \&quot;eksekutif class\&quot; are incredibly comfortable. The train has food and beverage sellers and even a restaurant cart. If you&#39;re on a tight budget you can use this bus from Bandung to Jogja.\n\nIt cost around 300,000 for a ticket, however, the journey took over 13 hours, which is including time spent stopping for passengers, toilet stops and lunch were included too (which was surprisingly tasty considering the ticket price!).\n\nWe love re-living and sharing these experiences, we hope you can get a bit of an insight into this fascinating place in Indonesia.

We will go into more depth on places we think to deserve moreattention in separate blogs but for a nice overview, here is ourIndonesian travel guide.\n\n## Bandung\n\nMy wife could go on for days about what Bandung is like as a city in general as she has spent most of her life living there! From a western perspective, Bandung is a breath of fresh air, it&#39;s the first city I visited after Jakarta and the climate is so much fresher. The air feels clean as it&#39;s surrounded by mountains/volcanos and the temperature is cooler as a result.\n\n### Gunung Tangkuban Perahu\n\nThis active volcano is stunning, it&#39;s about 30km north of Bandung city and it last erupted in 2019. In fact, it just recently started smoking again when we went back in February 2022\n\n![Kawa Ratu volcano](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Bandung/KawaRatu.webp)\n\nBecause of the weather, it was nice and quiet when we went too, plenty of space for photos and exploration.\n\n![Aidan and Arni enjoying Kawa Ratu volcano](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Bandung/TogetherByKawaRatuSign.webp)\n\n## Jogja\n\nJogja is a historical beauty of a place, countless choices to be made as there&#39;s a lot to see in this special city in Indonesia. [We go into detail here about what there is to see in Jogja](/posts/what-to-do-in-jogja) and where we&#39;d recommend based on our experience. A few places to note are:\n\n### Candhari Heaven restaurant\n\n![Candhari Heaven](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/niceResturant.webp)\n\nTo eat some delicious food with the most stunning backdrop and multiple places for memorable photos. We couldn&#39;t recommend this place enough. They sell a selection of refreshing drinks too so even after you&#39;re done eating, you can just relax with a few drinks and soak up that unique view of Jogja.\n\n### Malioboro\n\n![Malioboro street](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/malioboro.webp)\n\nThis is where it all happens, with countless shops and various street entertainers. The centre of Jogja is an active vibrant street, plenty to see here.\n\n### Borobudur\n\n![Borobudur](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Jogja/boroboudor.webp)\n\nJogja is a historic place with ancient temples that date way back. Borobudur dates back to the 9th century and is the largest Buddhist temple. If you&#39;re in the region, this is a must-see.\n\n### Malang\n\nDuring our journey through Java, we made our way east to Malang, this city feels so refreshing, surrounded by the most beautiful mountainous scenery. We had a tour with\n\nand we were so chuffed we chose them. They were very reasonable in price compared to some others and it only cost a little extra to include a cameraman who showed us all the best spots gave plenty of background and of course, took some stunning photos:\n\n![Bromo tour pic](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Malang/DSC01948.webp)\n\n![Bromo tour pic](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Malang/DSC01999.webp)\n\n![Bromo tour pic](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Malang/DSC02006.webp)\n\n![Bromo tour pic](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Malang/DSC02153.webp)\n\n![Bromo tour pic](/blog/whatToDoInIndonesia/Malang/20220603_012448778_iOS.webp)\n\nYou can visit this country time and time again and have a different experience every time.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your time and have safe travels ✈️🌍☀️🏔️\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Indonesia travel guide&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Indonesia travel guide&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;July 15 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/what-to-do-in-indonesia.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Travel&quot;],[0,&quot;Indonesia&quot;],[0,&quot;Entertainment&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;obtaining-a-family-visa.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;obtaining-a-family-visa&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# Getting a UK Family Visa\n\nThe family visa, in the past there were a couple more visas such as the parent visa or even the child visa, however now these all fall under the family visa category. Just to clear up any confusion, when we first started this process, we had no idea what the type of visa we wanted was. There are also fiance/fiancee visas or spouse visa types, with a fiance/spouse visa you can stay in the UK for up to 6 months, however, one of the requirements is that you must get married within this time period. If you do so, you can then apply to extend your stay and obtain a family visa (this can be a viable route if you and your partner both want to marry in the UK, however, it&#39;s going to be a pricy one as you&#39;ll have to pay for both the fiance/spouse visa application then the family visa. We&#39;ll get onto family visa pricing further down).\n\n## Expenses\n\nThe family visa is quite expensive. It cost us £1,682 for the application and an extra £2,047 for the IHS (health insurance surge) a payment that’s required as part of the application. We needed to get it right, to live our lives together and build our future.\n\n## Visa Consultant\n\nThat’s why we hired a visa consultant from [I-vars](https://www.i-vars.com/). Their service was unbelievably helpful, they start with an initial call, going through the process itself and they get to understand you and your situation so they can know how to best help. Once signed up they send a pack with all the information about the visa application process and documents required to get the approval we all need. They will review any documents and give guidance throughout the process.\n\n# The application\n\nOn to the application itself then, it’s all done online [here through the gov website.](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/partner-spouse) The majority of questions are self-explanatory. A few stand-out ones that could do with some further clarification:\n\n- When did you first meet?\n- - As we met online, we weren’t sure whether to put the date we first talked online or the first time we physically met each other in person for the first time. We were advised to put down the date we first talked to each online\n- Have you been declined entry or had a visa application declined before?\n- - Sadly, we had failed to obtain a visitor visa in the past, so we had to put down yes and explain a little about why. Hopefully, our wording can help you if you find yourself in a similar situation\n- - - \&quot;I applied for a visit visa to the UK so I could spend some time with my husband (at the time fiancé) Aidan. I really wanted to spend some quality time with him and meet his family, but sadly the visa application was declined. The ECO was not completely satisfied I would return to Indonesia at the end of the trip\&quot;\n\nThe application is pretty lengthy but most of the questions you just need to input data about yourself so they’re not too difficult.\n\nOnce you’ve paid and submitted your application, you will have to book an appointment to provide Biometric data. Once this appointment has been booked you can submit your supporting evidence to the visa centre.\n\n## Supporting Documents\n\nFirst off, it helps to know what you’re trying to prove with the documents;\n\n- Your partner or family member is one of the following:\n- - Has a British Citizenship\n- - Settlement or EU pre-settled status in the UK\n- - Asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK\n- You’re over 18\n- You’re in a marriage that is recognised in the UK\n- You intend to continue to living together in the UK after you apply\n- You and your family will have an adequate place to live in the UK&#39;\n- You have a good knowledge of English (either a degree taught in English validated by ECCTIS or a secure test at A1 CERF minimum)\n- You meet the financial requirements (your partner&#39;s salary must be over £18,600, which your partner has to of earned for the last 6 months at least)\n- You’re free from TB (if you live in a country that requires this)\n\nDocuments can be submitted after you&#39;ve completed the online application and created an appointment at your biometric centre of choice. Once you&#39;ve booked an appointment, you can start submitting documents online from when you book your appointment until 24 hours before your appointment. There are add-ons you can pay for such as document scanning assistance etc.\n\nThe actual documents checklist is relatively short. However, if you want a really solid application (which we all do, especially considering how pricy it is to even apply), then you’re going to want to submit a lot of supporting documents to make it undoubtedly that you hit the criteria mentioned above.\n\n## Conditional Documents\n\nThe TB test and Secure English language test are two bits of documents you may not even need to gather. However, if you do, you will need to study for the English test and book an appointment for the TB test which could take some time, so let us get those out the way first.\n\n### TB Test\n\nTo find out if your country is listed as needing a TB test, [visit this site provided by the British Government](https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk)\n\n### English Test\n\nThe official name for the English certificate you may need to provide is called the SELT (Secure English Language Test). If any of the following conditions are true, you DO NOT need to provide an SELT as part of your application.\n\n- You&#39;re applying as a child\n- You&#39;re applying as an adult coming to be cared for by a relative\n- You&#39;ve been in the UK on a family visa for 5 years and you&#39;re extending it as a partner or parent\n- You&#39;re over 65\n- You have a physical or mental condition that prevents you from meeting the requirement\n\nYou also will not need to prove your knowledge of English if you’re a national of one of the following countries:\n\n- Antigua and Barbuda\n- Australia\n- the Bahamas\n- Barbados\n- Belize\n- Canada\n- Dominica\n- Grenada\n- Guyana\n- Jamaica\n- Malta\n- New Zealand\n- St Kitts and Nevis\n- St Lucia\n- St Vincent and the Grenadines\n- Trinidad and Tobago\n- USA\n\nIf you don&#39;t meet any of the above conditions, you will need to study for your test, the one we prepared for and passed (hurray) was the IELTS. [Find our study guide here](/posts/how-to-pass-ielts)\n\nMore information about the CELT and a list of approved test centres in your country [can be found here on the GOV website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-english-language-abilities-with-a-secure-english-language-test-selt)\n\n## General Documents\n\nHere&#39;s a quickfire round regarding general documents you&#39;ll need to gather to support your application.\n\n- Current and any old passports\n- A copy of your partner&#39;s passport\n- Proof of your relationship (including your marriage certificate and evidence relating to time you have spent together as a couple)\n- Cover letters from you and your partner, together with supporting statements, including photographic evidence, from family, friends, employers etc. As you deem it necessary to prove your relationship is genuine\n- Sponsorship declaration from your partner/family member\n- Proof that any earlier relationships for either of you were over before you married (such as an affidavit or affirmation)\n\n## Financial and accommodation\n\nThe threshold to meet the UKVI financial requirements is an annual salary of at least £18,600. However, if you don&#39;t meet this requirement and have a substantial amount in savings, £60,000+, as long as you can prove these savings are accessible to you, you should be good.\n\nThe documents you should gather to prove your finances and that you&#39;ve got permission to stay wherever you said you would be staying in your visa application.\n\n- A letter from your partner&#39;s employers confirming their role, salary and tenure\n- Bank statements going back 6 months\n- Payslips going back 6 months\n- Evidence for your UK accommodation such as; estate agent’s details, tenancy agreements, a letter from the landlord if you’re renting\n\nPhew! That was a lot wasn&#39;t it! For personalised support on gathering the documents alone, we couldn&#39;t recommend i-vars, the visa counsellor, enough. They were superstars and answered all 1,000 questions we had for them. Now all that’s left is the waiting game. Usually, the visa will take less than 3 months to process, however with the pandemic there’s a bit of a backlog and it could take up to 4 months or so. The [current status of the waiting time can be seen here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-decision-waiting-times-applications-outside-the-uk?msclkid=81bf9ef8d12311ec9cea32779cb8b0d4#join-family-in-the-uk)\n\nAbout one month after we submitted our application, we received an email saying the application had reached the UK Decision making centre. They gave a final opportunity for us to provide any supporting docs via VSFGlobal or by directly sending the documents to an address in Birmingham England. Although they charged £100 to send the docs. It’s reassuring to know that if you did forget to submit a particular doc at the time of your application, it’s not your final chance to give UKVI everything they need to make your application succeed.\n\n## Visa Duration\n\nWith a UK family visa, you can initially stay in the UK for 2 years and 9 months. After this you&#39;ll be able to apply to extend your stay for another 2 years and 6 months. After you have lived in the UK for 5 years continuously on a family visa, you can apply to settle in the UK (called indefinite leave to remain or to put it in even simpler words, permanent residence).\n\nAll the best of luck to you and we wish you and your partner a happy life together.\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blog&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How to get a UK family visa&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;How to get a UK family visa&quot;],&quot;pubDate&quot;:[0,&quot;June 12 2022&quot;],&quot;heroImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/blog/obtaining-a-family-visa.webp&quot;],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,&quot;Visa&quot;]]]}],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-pass-ielts.md&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-pass-ielts&quot;],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;\n# How to get an IELTS A1 Certification for UKVI Family Visa Applications\n\nThe IELTS A1 exam is almost like a short interview, there will be you and one other test taker in the room with the examiner. The examiner will ask you and your partner a series of questions which you must respond to in English, there will also, be sections in the test where you will need to communicate with your partner. Luckily the test is broken up into 4 sections, and each section is clearly defined so you can go into the exam confident, knowing exactly what to expect.\n\n![IELTS A1 exam structure](/blog/how-to-pass-ielts/IELTSA1TestStructure.webp)\nJust to make that crystal clear, the sections are as follows:\n\n1. Phase 1A\n\n- Answering these 3 questions:\n- - Can you spell it for me? (You will be expected to spell out your full name, letter by letter)\n- - What&#39;s your name?\n- - Where do you come from?\n- Then you will answer some basic questions on small talk topics, such as food, hobbies and interests etc\n\n2. Phase 1B\n\n- You and your partner will be given a topic each, write down questions based on this topic and when instructed, you will ask your partner the questions you prepared and vice versa\n\n3. Phase 2A\n\n- The examiner will play a short recording, you will be given some paper with a few pictures on it, and answer the question by ticking one of the pictures provided\n\n4. Phase 2B\n\n- The examiner will give you both a topic that you need to have a conversation about\n\n---\n\nI know that was a lot about the structure of the test, but knowing this is valuable to understanding how to pass the test.\n\n\&quot;Sun Tzu said Know the enemy and know yourself in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.\&quot; ~ Sun Tzu\n\n## How we prepared for the test\n\nThere are a lot of great free resources out there that can make you as prepared as you&#39;ll ever be to pass the IELTS test. To get a better understanding of what we\\ve discussed and to see what your strengths/weaknesses are, you can go through a [sample test on ielts.org](https://www.ielts.org/about-ielts/ielts-for-migration/united-kingdom/ielts-life-skills). There are two samples on this website, papers A and B, both have their own audio tracks which should be played to answer the phase 2A questions.\n\nSeeing where your weak points are by going through a practice test is valuable, you can then focus on the areas you need to improve. If it&#39;s the speaking phases of the test, phases 1A, 2A and 2B, going through [this list of practice questions](https://www.ieltsdeal.com/ielts-life-skills-level-a1-speaking-basic-questions-with-answers/) and understanding the example answers given should help.
