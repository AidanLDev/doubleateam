# A short intro into AWS EC2

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular cloud computing platforms, offering a wide range of services for businesses of all sizes. One of the most widely used services in the AWS ecosystem is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). In this blog, we'll dive into what AWS EC2 is, how it works, and its key features.

## What is AWS EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a scalable cloud computing service that allows users to rent virtual servers (instances) in the cloud on an as-needed basis. EC2 instances can be easily launched and terminated, providing businesses with the flexibility to scale their computing resources up or down as needed. EC2 is part of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) category, which means that it provides the underlying computing infrastructure for building applications.

## How does EC2 work?
AWS EC2 works by providing users with virtual servers, which are known as instances. Users can launch instances with a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Instances are launched within virtual private clouds (VPCs), which are isolated network environments that allow users to control access to their instances.

Users can configure their instances with various specifications, including the amount of memory, storage, and processing power required. Instances can also be configured to auto-scale, which means that they can automatically adjust their capacity based on demand.

## EC2 Key Features
1. Scalability: AWS EC2 allows users to scale their computing resources up or down as needed, providing businesses with the flexibility to meet changing demands.
2. Security: EC2 instances are launched within virtual private clouds (VPCs), providing users with complete control over their network security.
3. Availability: EC2 instances can be easily launched in multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring that applications are highly available and resilient to failures.
4. Pricing: EC2 instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning that users only pay for the resources they use.
5. Integration with other AWS services: EC2 instances can be easily integrated with other AWS services, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).

## In conclusion...
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a scalable cloud computing service that provides businesses with the flexibility to rent virtual servers on an as-needed basis. EC2 instances can be easily launched and terminated, providing businesses with the ability to scale their computing resources up or down as needed. With its scalability, security, availability, pricing, and integration with other AWS services, EC2 is a powerful tool for businesses looking to build applications in the cloud." name=description><meta content="Aidan Lowson" name=author><meta content=website property=og:type><meta content=https://blog.aidanlowson.com/posts/aws-ec2/ property=og:url><meta content="AWS EC2 Intro" property=og:title><meta content="
