# UKs Best Theme parks

This island holds a lot of thrill, with some of the world's best coasters scattered between various parks. Let's dive deep into what parks are here in the UK.

## 1. Alton Towers

![Towers](/blog/best-uk-theme-parks.webp)
Stoke-On-Trent | £36 online or free with a Merlin Pass

Alton Towers is not only home to some of the best thrill rides you'll find anywhere in this world, hosting 10 record-breaking coasters, but also some of the most beautiful scenery surrounding an old stately home.

Prepare to get plenty of steps in as this park covers 910 acres, boasting over 40 attractions for both families and thrill seakers.

There's something for everyone at Alton Towers, with CBeebies land, hosting the David Walliams' Ganster Granny ride. To the likes of Nemesis, Oblivion and Smiler. You can even fly like superman on Galactica.

## 2. Thorpe Park

![Thorpe Park](/blog/theme-parks/thorpe-park/stealth.webp)
Staines | £37 online or free with a Merlin Pass

The Island like no other... Located in Staines, not too far from London, this park packs a punch. It's compact full of record breaking thrill rides such as the UK's fastest roller coaster Stealth.

Thorpe park as some incredibly well themes rides, such as the terrifying Walking Dead ride where you'll be chased by live actors, to Swarm, a fantastic wing coaster, where you fly past a crashed plane and through a billboard. SAW the ride branded as the first horror coaster will have you screaming as you rocket down a beyond vertical drop dodging sharp blades as you plumbit down.

## 3. Chessington World of Adventure

![Chessington World of Adventure](/blog/theme-parks/chessington/crock-drop-img.webp)
Surrey, Greater London | £39 online or free with a Merlin Pass

This family friendly Zoo/Theme park has a wide verity of attractions. The log flume, Tiger Rock, has you float past a Tiger enclosure on your journey through the water before you hit the big drop that is.

There's plenty for the children here, with Gruffalo and Room on a Broom just being a couple of them. The areas are well themed, especially the Mexicana area which had a welcome lick of paint recently, where you can ride the Scorpion Express, formally known as the Runaway Train.

The Vampire is a must ride, a well themed suspended coaster that has you flying above the park and Dragons Fury, the Maurer spinning coaster, never fails to put the biggest smile on my face. A unique ride every time as the spinning is completely random.

The coaster line-up is a bit light, but as of writting this artical, a B&#38;M wing coaster in the Jemanji land will be opening in 2023!

## 4. Legoland Windsor

![Legoland Windsor](/blog/theme-parks/legoland-windsor.webp)
Windsor | £32 Online or free with a Merlin Pass

Legoland just brings back the best memories, it's where I passed my first driving test at the age of 4 or so. Plenty to do here as a family.

It offers a few nicely themed coasters, Dragon and Dragon's Apprentice being two of them. They're both located in the knights kingdom and as the name suggests, themed to dragons

Miniland is a must visit while you're here, you can see some of the most famous attractions built in Lego with fantastic attention to detail.

## 5. Blackpool Pleasure Beach

![](/blog/theme-parks/blackpool/icon.webp)
Blackpool | £30 - £40 Online

I always feel like I'm going back in time when I step foot here, in the nicest way possible that is. They do have wooden coasters that have been around since the 1920s after all. The park has such a fun atmosphere and you get a great view of the sea too as it's right on the coast.

There's many unique attractions here, such as Revolution, a launch into a loop... then you get launched backwards back through the loop! It's surprisingly intense and a LOT of fun. Avalanche, a bobsled coaster and just so much more.

The Icon is regarded as the best in the UK by many thrill seekers, this double launch coaster is such a blast every time I ride it. Talking of coasters, you can't forget the BIG ONE, still the tallest in the UK, a title it's held since 1994 (the best year). Although Thorpe Park might have there eyes on that record (if planning permissions ever get accepted).

## 6. Paultons

![Paultons](/blog/theme-parks/paultons.webp)
Romsey, Hampshire | £40 Online (under 1m get in for free)

Paultons, home of Pepper Pig land, a family friendly theme park that has plenty to keep a thrill seeker entertained. The park has a relaxing atmosphere with beautiful gardens and animals.

We can't talk about Paultons without mentioning one of the best UK coasters, Storm Chaser, a fun spinning coaster that will have you smiling from ear to ear. In fact the new Tornado Springs area that opened in 2021 is so well themed throughout.

## 7. Adventure Island

![Adventure Island](/blog/theme-parks/adventure-island.webp)
Southend-on-Sea | Free entry to the park and Pay n Play or £22.50 wristband for unlimited rides

This theme park has a classic amusement park feel to it. Located right on the coast, it offers some fantastic thrills with the likes of Rage, that features a 97 degree drop! That's beyond vertical.

The park offers some classic attractions such as the Crooked House and Helter Skelter.

## 8. Flamingo Land

![Flamingo Land](/blog/theme-parks/flamingoland.webp)
Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire | £29 - 40 Online

I know, the name suggests that this is just a place full of Flamingos... although it does have a Zoo, this &#34;Theme park resort&#34; also offers some thrills from rides such as Flip Flop and Cliff Hanger. In fact the Zoo is well maintained and attracts more visitors than the ZSL London Zoo which is impressive.

The park offers plenty of attractions for children too with the likes of Mumbo Jumbo and Vortex.

The park's latest coaster &#34;Sik&#34;, which packs in a whopping 10 inversions, just opened this year and is well worth a ride.

## 9. Drayton Manor

![Drayton Manor](/blog/theme-parks/drayton-manor.webp)
Mileoak, Brighton | £27.50

Drayton Manor is a great family park with a solid line up of attractions. Loki is just mesmorising to look at off ride. The park hosts the UKs only standing roller coaster, Shockwave, which is just an experience that feels incredibly odd, a must try experience.

For younger children there's an entire Thomas the Tank Engine section. Other family favorites are Flying Dutchman and Accelerator. Thrill seekers will enjoy Shockwave and on a sunny day Stormforce 10 is sure to cool you down.

Overall this park has improved in recent years, the theming of it's new Viking land has a lot of attention to detail. I mean just look at Loki... How can you take your eyes off it?!

## 10. Oakwood Theme Park

![Oakwood Theme Park](/blog/theme-parks/oakwood.webp)
Pembrokeshire, South Wales | £27 - £37

The biggest theme park in Wales, the hosts of Megafobia which is a highly rated wooden coaster. There's a good variety of rides across the park, the other thrill coaster Speed is a lot of fun too. There are a couple of family friendly coasters too so the whole family can enjoy a day out in Oakwood.

The park is green and spacious in the beautiful Welsh countryside. Not a bad small park, worth a visit if you're in the area. Especially if you want to ride a great woddie.

It’s compact full of record breaking thrill rides such as the UK’s fastest roller coaster Stealth.</p><p>Thorpe park as some incredibly well themes rides, such as the terrifying Walking Dead ride where you’ll be chased by live actors, to Swarm, a fantastic wing coaster, where you fly past a crashed plane and through a billboard.

The log flume, Tiger Rock, has you float past a Tiger enclosure on your journey through the water before you hit the big drop that is.</p><p>There’s plenty for the children here, with Gruffalo and Room on a Broom just being a couple of them. The areas are well themed, especially the Mexicana area which had a welcome lick of paint recently, where you can ride the Scorpion Express, formally known as the Runaway Train.</p><p>The Vampire is a must ride, a well themed suspended coaster that has you flying above the park and Dragons Fury, the Maurer spinning coaster, never fails to put the biggest smile on my face. A unique ride every time as the spinning is completely random.</p><p>The coaster line-up is a bit light, but as of writting this artical, a B&#x26;M wing coaster in the Jemanji land will be opening in 2023!</p><h2 id=4-legoland-windsor>4. Legoland Windsor</h2><p><img alt="Legoland Windsor" src=/blog/theme-parks/legoland-windsor.webp> Windsor | £32 Online or free with a Merlin Pass</p><p>Legoland just brings back the best memories, it’s where I passed my first driving test at the age of 4 or so. Plenty to do here as a family.</p><p>It offers a few nicely themed coasters, Dragon and Dragon’s Apprentice being two of them. They’re both located in the knights kingdom and as the name suggests, themed to dragons</p><p>Miniland is a must visit while you’re here, you can see some of the most famous attractions built in Lego with fantastic attention to detail.</p><h2 id=5-blackpool-pleasure-beach>5. Blackpool Pleasure Beach</h2><p><img alt="" src=/blog/theme-parks/blackpool/icon.webp> Blackpool | £30 - £40 Online</p><p>I always feel like I’m going back in time when I step foot here, in the nicest way possible that is. They do have wooden coasters that have been around since the 1920s after all. The park has such a fun atmosphere and you get a great view of the sea too as it’s right on the coast.</p><p>There’s many unique attractions here, such as Revolution, a launch into a loop… then you get launched backwards back through the loop! It’s surprisingly intense and a LOT of fun. Avalanche, a bobsled coaster and just so much more.</p><p>The Icon is regarded as the best in the UK by many thrill seekers, this double launch coaster is such a blast every time I ride it. Talking of coasters, you can’t forget the BIG ONE, still the tallest in the UK, a title it’s held since 1994 (the best year). Although Thorpe Park might have there eyes on that record (if planning permissions ever get accepted).</p><h2 id=6-paultons>6. Paultons</h2><p><img alt=Paultons src=/blog/theme-parks/paultons.webp> Romsey, Hampshire | £40 Online (under 1m get in for free)</p><p>Paultons, home of Pepper Pig land, a family friendly theme park that has plenty to keep a thrill seeker entertained. The park has a relaxing atmosphere with beautiful gardens and animals.</p><p>We can’t talk about Paultons without mentioning one of the best UK coasters, Storm Chaser, a fun spinning coaster that will have you smiling from ear to ear. In fact the new Tornado Springs area that opened in 2021 is so well themed throughout.</p><h2 id=7-adventure-island>7.

That’s beyond vertical.</p><p>The park offers some classic attractions such as the Crooked House and Helter Skelter.</p><h2 id=8-flamingo-land>8. Flamingo Land</h2><p><img alt="Flamingo Land" src=/blog/theme-parks/flamingoland.webp> Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire | £29 - 40 Online</p><p>I know, the name suggests that this is just a place full of Flamingos… although it does have a Zoo, this “Theme park resort” also offers some thrills from rides such as Flip Flop and Cliff Hanger. In fact the Zoo is well maintained and attracts more visitors than the ZSL London Zoo which is impressive.</p><p>The park offers plenty of attractions for children too with the likes of Mumbo Jumbo and Vortex.</p><p>The park’s latest coaster “Sik”, which packs in a whopping 10 inversions, just opened this year and is well worth a ride.</p><h2 id=9-drayton-manor>9. Drayton Manor</h2><p><img alt="Drayton Manor" src=/blog/theme-parks/drayton-manor.webp> Mileoak, Brighton | £27.50</p><p>Drayton Manor is a great family park with a solid line up of attractions. Loki is just mesmorising to look at off ride. The park hosts the UKs only standing roller coaster, Shockwave, which is just an experience that feels incredibly odd, a must try experience.</p><p>For younger children there’s an entire Thomas the Tank Engine section. Other family favorites are Flying Dutchman and Accelerator. Thrill seekers will enjoy Shockwave and on a sunny day Stormforce 10 is sure to cool you down.</p><p>Overall this park has improved in recent years, the theming of it’s new Viking land has a lot of attention to detail. I mean just look at Loki… How can you take your eyes off it?!</p><h2 id=10-oakwood-theme-park>10. Oakwood Theme Park</h2><p><img alt="Oakwood Theme Park" src=/blog/theme-parks/oakwood.webp> Pembrokeshire, South Wales | £27 - £37</p><p>The biggest theme park in Wales, the hosts of Megafobia which is a highly rated wooden coaster. There’s a good variety of rides across the park, the other thrill coaster Speed is a lot of fun too. There are a couple of family friendly coasters too so the whole family can enjoy a day out in Oakwood.</p><p>The park is green and spacious in the beautiful Welsh countryside. Not a bad small park, worth a visit if you’re in the area. Especially if you want to ride a great woddie.</p></div></section></main><footer><section class=py-8><div class=container><p>&copy; 2024 - Aidan Lowson 😎</p></div></section></footer></body></html>
