      <Text>
        For the family visa it’s quite expensive. It cost us £1,682 for the
        application and an extra £2,047 for the IHS (health insurance surge)
        payment that’s required as part of the application. We needed to get it
        right, to live our lives together and build our future.

      <Text>
        That’s why we hired a visa consultant from{' '}
        <a href='https://www.i-vars.com/'>I-vars</a>. Their service was
        unbelievably helpful, they start with an initial call, going through the
        process itself and they get to understand you and your situation so they
        can know how to best help. Once signed up they send a pack with all the
        information about the visa application process and documents required to
        get the approval we all need. They will review any documents and give
        guidance throughout the process.

          here through the gov website.

        The majority of questions are self-explanatory. A few stand out ones
        that could do with some further clarification:

        <ListItem>When did you first meet?</ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          As we met online, we weren’t really sure whether to put the date we
          first talked online or the first time we physically met each other in
          person for the first time. We were advised to put down the date we
          first talked to each online
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Have you been declined entry or had a visa application declined
          before?
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Sadly, we had failed to obtain a visitor visa in the past, so we had
          to put down yes and explain a little about why. To get the wording
          100% we reached out and were advised to put the following (this will
          be specific to our situation as the reason the visitor visa was
          declined was due to UKVI thinking ties to the original country weren’t
          strong enough and by the end of the visa, they thought she wouldn’t
          leave the UK) I applied for a visit visa to the UK so I could spend
          some time with my husband (at the time fiancé) Aidan. I really wanted
          to spend some quality time with him and meet his family, but sadly the
          visa application was declined The ECO was not completely satisfied I
          would return to Indonesia at the end of the trip

        The application is pretty lengthy but most of the questions you just
        need to input data about yourself so they’re not too difficult.

      <Text>
        Once you’ve paid and submitted your application, you will have to book
        an appointment to provide Biometric data. Once this appointment has been
        booked you can submit your supporting evidence to the visa centre.

        First off, it helps to know what you’re trying to prove with the
        documents;
      </Text>
      <List>
        <ListItem>
          Your partner or family member is one of the following:

        <ListItem>- Has a British Citizenship</ListItem>
        <ListItem>- Settlement or EU pre-settled status in the UK</ListItem>
        <ListItem>- Asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK</ListItem>

          You’re free from TB (if you live in a country that requires this)
        </ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text>
        In my opinion, this is the most difficult part, the actual documents
        checklist is relatively short. However, if you want a really solid
        application (which we all do, especially considering how pricy it is to
        even apply), then you’re going to want to submit a lot of supporting
        documents.

        Now you’ve got all that, all that’s left is the waiting game. Usually,
        the visa will take less than 3 months to process, however with the
        pandemic there’s a bit of a back log and it could take up to 4 months or
        so.

        All the best of luck to you and we wish you and your partner a happy
