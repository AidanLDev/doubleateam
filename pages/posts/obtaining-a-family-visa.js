        For the family visa it’s quite expensive. It cost us £1,682 for the
        application and an extra £2,047 for the IHS (health insurance surge)
        payment that’s required as part of the application. We needed to get it
        right, to live our lives together and build our future.

      <Heading size='md'>Visa Consultant</Heading>
      <Text>
        That’s why we hired a visa consultant from{' '}
        <a href='https://www.i-vars.com/'>I-vars</a>. Their service was
        unbelievably helpful, they start with an initial call, going through the
        process itself and they get to understand you and your situation so they
        can know how to best help. Once signed up they send a pack with all the
        information about the visa application process and documents required to
        get the approval we all need. They will review any documents and give
        guidance throughout the process.

        The majority of questions are self-explanatory. A few stand out ones
        that could do with some further clarification:

To get the wording100% we reached out and were advised to put the following (this will be specific to our situation as the reason the visitor visa was declined was due to UKVI thinking ties to the original country weren’t strong enough and by the end of the visa, they thought she wouldn’t leave the UK) I applied for a visit visa to the UK so I could spend some time with my husband (at the time fiancé) Aidan. I really wanted to spend some quality time with him and meet his family, but sadly the visa application was declined The ECO was not completely satisfied I would return to Indonesia at the end of the trip',

          },
        ]}

      <Text>
        The application is pretty lengthy but most of the questions you just
        need to input data about yourself so they’re not too difficult.

      <Text>
        Once you’ve paid and submitted your application, you will have to book
        an appointment to provide Biometric data. Once this appointment has been
        booked you can submit your supporting evidence to the visa centre.

        First off, it helps to know what you’re trying to prove with the
        documents;

        In my opinion, this is the most difficult part, the actual documents
        checklist is relatively short. However, if you want a really solid
        application (which we all do, especially considering how pricy it is to
        even apply), then you’re going to want to submit a lot of supporting
        documents to make it undoubtable that you hit the criteria mentioned
        above.

        The TB test and Secure English language test are two bits of documents
        you may not even need to gather. However if you do, you will need to
        study for the English test and book an appointment for the TB test which
        could take some time, so lets get those out the way with first.

        The official name for the English certificate you may need to provide is
        called the SELT (Secure English Language Test). If any of the following
        conditions are true, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> need to provide an SELT
        as part of your application.

        The threshold to meet the UKVI financial requirements is an annual
        salary of at least £18,600. However, if you don't meet this requirement
        and have a substantial amount in savings, £60,000+, as long as you can
        prove these savings are accessible to you, you should be good.

        the documents alone, we couldn't reccomed i-vars, the visa counciler,
        enough. They were super stars and answered all 1,000 questions we had
        for them. Now all that’s left is the waiting game. Usually, the visa
        will take less than 3 months to process, however with the pandemic
        there’s a bit of a back log and it could take up to 4 months or so. The{' '}

        About one month after we submitted our application, we received an email
        saying the application had reached the UK Decision making centre. They
        gave a final opportunity for us to provide any supporting docs via
        VSFGlobal or by directly sending the documents to an address in
        Birmingham England. Although they charged £100 to send the docs. It’s
        reassuring to know that if you did forget to submit a particular doc at
        the time of your application, it’s not your final chance to give UKVI
        everything they need to make your application succeed.
