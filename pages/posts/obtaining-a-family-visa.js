      The family visa, in the past there were a couple more visas such as the
      parent visa or even the child visa, however now these all fall under the
      family visa category. Just to clear up any confusion, when we first
      started this process, we had no idea what the type of visa we wanted was.
      There are also fiance/fiancee visas or spouse visa types, with a
      fiance/spouse visa you can stay in the UK for up to 6 months, however, one
      of the requirements is that you must get married within this time period.
      If you do so, you can then apply to extend your stay and obtain a family
      visa (this can be a viable route if you and your partner both want to
      marry in the UK, however, it's going to be a pricy one as you'll have to
      pay for both the fiance/spouse visa application then the family visa.
      We'll get onto family visa pricing further down).

      The family visa it’s quite expensive. It cost us £1,682 for the
      application and an extra £2,047 for the IHS (health insurance surge) a
      payment that’s required as part of the application. We needed to get it
      right, to live our lives together and build our future.

      Documents can be submitted after you've completed the online application
      and created an appointment at your biometric centre of choice. Once you've
      booked an appointment, you can start submitting documents online from when

      The actual documents checklist is relatively short. However, if you want a
      really solid application (which we all do, especially considering how
      pricy it is to even apply), then you’re going to want to submit a lot of
      supporting documents to make it undoubtedly that you hit the criteria

      About one month after we submitted our application, we received an email

      gave a final opportunity for us to provide any supporting docs via
      VSFGlobal or by directly sending the documents to an address in Birmingham
      England. Although they charged £100 to send the docs. It’s reassuring to
      know that if you did forget to submit a particular doc at the time of your

      With a UK family visa, you can initially stay in the UK for 2 years and 9
      months. After this you'll be able to apply to extend your stay for another
      2 years and 6 months. After you have lived in the UK for 5 years
      continuously on a family visa, you can apply to settle in the UK (called
      indefinite leave to remain or to put it in even simpler words, permanent
      residence).

      If you don't meet any of the above conditions, you will need to study for
      your test, the one we prepared for and passed (hurray) was the IELTS.{' '}

      Here's a quickfire round regarding general documents you'll need to gather
      to support your application.

        { text: 'Current and any old passports' },

      The threshold to meet the UKVI financial requirements is an annual salary
      of at least £18,600. However, if you don't meet this requirement and have
      a substantial amount in savings, £60,000+, as long as you can prove these
      savings are accessible to you, you should be good.

      permission to stay wherever you said you would be staying in your visa

      Phew! That was a lot wasn't it! For personalised support on gathering the
      documents alone, we couldn't recommend i-vars, the visa counsellor,
      enough. They were superstars and answered all 1,000 questions we had for
      them. Now all that’s left is the waiting game. Usually, the visa will take
      less than 3 months to process, however with the pandemic there’s a bit of
      a backlog and it could take up to 4 months or so. The{' '}

      About one month after we submitted our application, we received an email
      saying the application had reached the UK Decision making centre. They
      gave a final opportunity for us to provide any supporting docs via
      VSFGlobal or by directly sending the documents to an address in Birmingham
      England. Although they charged £100 to send the docs. It’s reassuring to
      know that if you did forget to submit a particular doc at the time of your
      application, it’s not your final chance to give UKVI everything they need
      to make your application succeed.

    <Text>
      With a UK family visa, you can initially stay in the UK for 2 years and 9
      months. After this you'll be able to apply to extend your stay for another
      2 years and 6 months. After you have lived in the UK for 5 years
      continuously on a family visa, you can apply to settle in the UK (called
      indefinite leave to remain or to put it in even simpler words, permanent
      residence).
