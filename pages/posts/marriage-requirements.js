      Weddings in Indonesia are always religious ceremonies, this can make
      things a bit complicated if you’re from a different religious background
      from your spouse. However, with the right documents, this isn’t an issue.
      We’ll talk through everything we needed to get married and the steps we
      took to get there.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      If you’re a British citizen this will ask you to go through a short series
      of questions to point you to the embassy, you need to contact to get the
      required wedding docs{' '}

      There are a few documents the foreign spouse will need for getting married
      in Indonesia.

        {
          text: 'If the Indonesian spouse is Muslim, you will need a shahada certificate. I got mine from the central London Mosque, you can contact them here.

        },
        {
          text: 'ID - Your passport, which you should have with you anyways! So, this requirement is a freebee yay. Just in case you might want to bring along something like a driving licence if you have one ',

      if you are from the UK and need to get your hands on a shahada certificate

    <Text>
      These docs may not be necessary however some areas may have stricter KUAs
      who will require the following:

    <StyledUL
      items={[

      Again these docs may not be necessary however some KUAs will ask for the

      English documents will need to be translated by an approved sworn

    <Text>
      You want to choose a translator who can translate documents, it’s best to
      ask a few for their price list as they can vary a lot from one translator
      to another.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      The only two documents I needed translating were my birth certificate and
      passport. Luckily for us, the British embassy printed out the Affidavit in
      both English and Indonesian so that didn’t need translating, if you don’t
      have the Affidavit/ affirmation in Indonesian you’ll have to get that
      translated too.

      Prenup and Indonesian marriage rights for marriages with foreign spouses
    </Heading>
    <Text>
      This part is a bit complicated… sadly if you do get married to a foreign
      spouse, the local spouse will lose their property and inheritance rights
      in Indonesia. This is because when married, they share the rights of their
      spouse, their spouse being foreign doesn’t have property rights therefore
      they inherit the same rights as a result… Or something along those lines!
    </Text>
    <Text>
      To avoid this, we contacted a notary to arrange a prenup (pre-marital
      agreement) that would allow my lovely wife the rights she deserves. A list
      of English-speaking notaries who are in Indonesia{' '}

        can be found here.
      </SimpleLink>{' '}
      Although we just found a notary local to where my wife lives in Bandung
      and they were super helpful. Overall, the prenup cost us 2.5 million

      Documents from various Indonesian administration areas (RT & RW &
      Kelurahan & Kecematan)
    </Heading>
    <Text>
      First, a bit of explaining what those words above mean: Indonesia is
      divided into different regions, in these regions they’re third-level
      administrative subdivisions below regencies or cities known as Kacematans.
      Kelurahan is a subdivision below kacematans, so they’re a fourth-level
      subdivision which translates to “villages” in English. Finally, below
      this, we have the RT (rukun tetangga which can translate to “neighbourhood
      unit”) and RW (Rukan Warga which can translate to “community unit”). These
      are the division below the Kelurahan. An RW is made up of many RT, so that
      is the most local area to an Indonesian resident. I hope this at least
      slightly makes sense, to me it’s still confusing, Indonesia is just such a
      huge country, so it can take a lot to get our heads around how it’s
      divided up and organised if you haven’t lived there.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      You’ll need to grab a handful of documents from your local RT/RW and
      attach some of the documents mentioned above in the documents required
      section. Once you have the translated documents, visit the local Kelurahan
      and provide them with the relevant documents. After finishing with the
      kelurahan documents, go to the kacamatan to request the documents for the
      KUA.
    </Text>
    <Heading size='md'>Immunisation</Heading>
    <Text>
      After we visited the KUA with copies of the documents from the various
      regency offices, the Indonesian spouse had to get a tetanus immunisation
      before we could marry.
    </Text>
    <Heading>Congratulations</Heading>
    <Text>
      Bring all the documents to the KUA and that’s that! You’re ready to get
      married
    </Text>
    <Text>
      The start of your new life as husband and wife, suami and istri, can now
      begin. Enjoy the precious time with family and friends, savour the moment,
      but most importantly look after each other and enjoy the rest of your
      lives together ❤️
