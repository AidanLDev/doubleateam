      The IELTS A1 exam is almost like a short interview, there will be you and
      one other test taker in the room with the examiner. The examiner will ask
      you and your partner a series of questions which you must respond to in
      English, there will also, be sections in the test where you will need to
      communicate with your partner. Luckily the test is broken up into 4
      sections, and each section is clearly defined so you can go into the exam
      confident, knowing exactly what to expect.

      Here is the structure of the exam, it's broken up into 4 phases 1A, 1B, 2A
      and 2B:

      </Flex>
    </Text>

      Just to make that crystal clear, the sections are as follows:
      <StyledUL
        items={[
          {
            text: <b>Phase 1A</b>,
          },
          { text: 'Answering these 3 questions:' },
          { text: "What's your name?", isNested: true },
          {
            text: 'Can you spell it for me? (You will be expected to spell out your full name, letter by letter)',
            isNested: true,
          },
          { text: 'Where do you come from?', isNested: true },
          {
            text: 'Then you will answer some basic questions on small talk topics, such as food, hobbies and interests etc',
          },
          { text: <b>Phase 1B</b> },
          {
            text: 'You and your partner will be given a topic each, write down questions based on this topic and when instructed, you will ask your partner the questions you prepared and vice versa',
          },
          { text: <b>Phase 2A</b> },
          {
            text: 'The examiner will play a short recording, you will be given some paper with a few pictures on it, and answer the question by ticking one of the pictures provided',
          },
          { text: <b>Phase 2B</b> },
          {
            text: 'The examiner will give you both a topic that you need to have a conversation about',
          },
        ]}
      />
      <StyledDivider />I know that was a lot about the structure of the test,
      but knowing this well is so valuable to understanding how to pass the
      test.
