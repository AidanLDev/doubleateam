      We stayed very central in the <b>Jambuluwuk Malioboro Hotel</b>. This is a
      large hotel with some outstanding views, friendly staff and a huge buffet
      breakfast with foods from all over Indonesia and even some European
      options. I mean just check out this stunning garden you'll be stuffing
      your faces in!

      </Center>
      The hotel has a laundry service and is within walking distance to the
      popular shopping district in Malioboro. Plenty to see and do just on your
      doorstep! The hotel was reasonable considering the location and especially
      considering the 5* service we were getting, the staff were stars and the
      hotel itself was so well furnished. It cost around Â£27 (est 487.000 IDR) a
      night

      We fancied heading out of the main part of the city to soak in some of the
      views you can get around Jogja. At the <b>Candhari Heaven</b> you can do
      just that while eating some delicious Indonesian food or even just sitting
      back and enjoying some of their refreshing fruit smoothies.

      Now this place does get busy, so to guarantee a table we would recommend
      booking in advance.{' '}

      What a fun place to be! If you fancy doing some shopping or eating ice
      cream, Malioboro is the place to do it. With countless street performers
      and more shops than you'll know what to do with, this vibrant place is a
      must-visit when coming to Jogja.

      Now all of those activities we've talked about so far happen in the heart
      of Jogja, however, if you venture outside the city by an hour or so,
      there's so much history and beauty to be witnessed. Now if there's one the
      thing we love more than travel, it's sleep, so in order to make it to the
      famous sunrise spot "Punthuk Setumbu", we'd have to be a little closer to
      it than our hotel near Malioboro.{' '}
      <b>Balkondes Ngargogondo The Gade Village</b> was fairly pricy for what
      you get at 500.000 IDR a night, but what a location. It was only 15 mins
      away from Punthuk Setumbu and felt like such a breathe of fresh air,
      you're truly out in nature here.
      <Center>
        <Image src={`${imagePath}hotel2Rooms.jpg`} alt='Gade Village rooms' />
      </Center>
      Just looking at those rooms relaxes me, beautiful. The welcome we got
      there was top notch too, we were given complimentary drinks and breakfast
      was brought to our door as there was an event on that morning so we
      couldn't use the restaurant.

      The breakfast was tasty and traditional, although we do love our breakfast
      buffets where we can stuff our faces until our bellies can't fit any more
      food in.

      The reason why we trecked outside of the city, and my god was it worth it.
      <Image src={`${imagePath}sunriseSignCrop.jpg`} alt='Punthuk Setumbu' />
      This popular sunrise location is popular for a reason. Sadly it was a a
      bit cloudy for us to get the full sunrise experience, but we did however
      get blown away by the beauty of the place.
      <Image src={`${imagePath}sunrisePlace.jpg`} alt='Punthuk Setumbu' />
      There are plenty of places for some the most memorable photos too if
      that's what you're into.

      We'll let the pictures do all the talking for this one...

      <Image src={`${imagePath}sunrisePlace3.jpg`} alt='Punthuk Setumbu' />
      Even though you're out in the middle of nowhere, there are food sellers,
      and toilets too. What more could you ask for ðŸ˜‰

    <Heading>Borobudur</Heading>
    <Text>
      You can't come out all the way to Jogja and not visit one of its ancient
      temples. We were torn between two, with it being our final day in Jogja we
      could only choose one, Borobudur or the Prambanan Temple... well as we're
      talking about Borobudur you can guess which we chose. Borobudur Temple is
      magnificent, the biggest Buddhist temple built. For Indonesian citizen's
      tickets are very cheap, however, if you're foreign you will be expected to
      pay a bit extra, around Â£20 overall, however where else can you see such a
      magnificent landmark? Worth every penny.

    <Heading>Travelling to Jogja</Heading>
    <Text>
      In case you're travelling to Jogja within Indonesia like we were, we
      thought we'd go through some options. We made the journey from Bandung,
      the comfortable quicker way was using the train. Even the cheapest seats
      "eksekutif class" are incredibly comfortable. The train has food and
      beverage sellers and even a restaurant cart. If you're on a tight budget
      you can use this bus from Bandung to Jogja.

          alt='bus to Jogja'
        />
      </Center>
      It cost around 300,000 for a ticket, however, the journey took over 13
      hours, which is including time spent stopping for passengers, toilet stops
      and lunch were included too (which was surprisingly tasty considering the
      ticket price!).

      We love re-living and sharing these experiences, we hope you can get a bit
      of an insight into this fascinating place in Indonesia. Safe travels to
